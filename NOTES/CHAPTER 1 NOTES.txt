File system module in node

-> A module named fs is used

-> const fs = require('fs');

Some functions of file system module:
    readFileSync('filename', 'encoding') -> It will read the files synchronously, therefore server will do the tasks linewise
                                            That is, big operations will take up server's time as they came first which is not expected(Bad practise)

    readFile -> Give response in callbacks. Asynchronous function.
                fs.readFile('demo.txt', 'utf-8', ('err', txt)=>{
                    console.log(txt)
                })
                First and second parameters are always error and content followed by anything else.
